Most of my writings are either grandiose projects never completed or highly sentimental walls of text spewed out late at night over bottles of peach soju. But I try to write as much as I can, and I try to share these pieces of me from time to time so that strings of words might somehow thread our histories.

Comments/feedback always appreciated!
