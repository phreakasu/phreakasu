Hi I’m Susan!

Welcome to my personal page, where I post [random life updates](https://suasn.substack.com/), make [a lot of lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/fun), and try to gather all my *Productive Things* in one place in case you want to hire me or something. 

I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, focusing on biological engineering and global development (a.k.a. "2A 20+D-Lab"), and a humanities concentration in public policy. Since then, I've worked on infrastructure development for a prosthetics clinic in Sierra Leone and co-founded a [manufacturing consultancy](https://thesparrows.co/) helping hardware companies build their products in China. I recently moved back to Cambridge, MA -- say hi if you're in town!

I enjoy seeking out experiences that challenge my perspective of the world, and one of my biggest fears is to live a boring life. In my spare time, I like to run/bike around the city (and rate its bike lanes), write dystopian fiction (and overly sentimental blogs), seek out specialty coffee beans, and visit contemporary art exhibitions.

## Interests

**Academic/more technical:** bioengineering (esp. biomaterials, assistive tech, & low-cost medical devices), global health, public policy, social entrepreneurship, open-source technologies, co-design, social activism (particularly in Asia), US-China relations

**Miscellaneous:** tennis (my favorite player is Petra Kvitova!), coffee, bartending & mixology, creative writing, contemporary Chinese theater, public art, and most recently, podcasting (check out my podcast, [Liminal Space](https://liminalspace.transistor.fm/)!)

Feel free to reach out via susan.su312@gmail.com. Ciao.
