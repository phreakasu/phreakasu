Hi Iâ€™m Susan!

Welcome to my personal page, where I post [random life updates](https://suasn.substack.com/), make a lot of lists, and attempt to Be Productive as I wander about for the next few months (years?).

I graduated from MIT in 2023 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on biological engineering and global development (a.k.a. "2A 20+D-Lab"), and a humanities concentration in public policy. Since then, I've worked on infrastructure development for a prosthetics clinic in Sierra Leone and as a clinical engineer for a surgical robotics company in Hong Kong. I currently run [The Sparrows](https://thesparrows.co/), a manufacturing consultancy helping companies build their products in China. 

I enjoy seeking out experiences that challenge my perspective of the world, and one of my biggest fears is to live a boring life. In my spare time, I like to run/bike around the city (and rate its bike lanes), talk to interesting people, write dystopian fiction (and overly sentimental blogs), and visit contemporary art exhibitions.

## Interests

Academic/more technical: bioengineering (esp. biomaterials, assistive tech, & low-cost medical devices), global health, public policy, social entrepreneurship, open-source technologies, co-design, social activism (particularly in Asia), US-China relations

Miscellaneous: tennis (my favorite player is Petra Kvitova!), coffee, bartending & mixology, creative writing, contemporary Chinese theater, public art, and long stretching routines
