In MIT’s Mechanical Engineering senior capstone class, 2.009, teams develop a completed product from start to finish, culminating in a live showcase at the end of the semester. My team developed Grippi, a rechargeable, battery-powered assistive gripper that operates without the need for a sustained grip from the user. Specific tasks I was in charge of include: mechanical design of the claw, silicone casting and molding of the claw interior, senior center outreach for user interviews, product testing, and presenting the product at the final showcase. I also served as the team’s Yoda officer, responsible for resolving team conflicts and boosting morale.
