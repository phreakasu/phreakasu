## A Hyper-Compact Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Plant Model for Integration into Beijing’s Chaoyang District (June-Aug. 2021)

### Ballistic Architecture Machine (BAM)

As a design intern at BAM, I researched the restructuring of Waste-to-Energy (WTE) infrastructure for the Chinese city. WTE plants are waste management facilities that use the incineration of solid, industrial, and/or hazardous waste to produce electricity. I investigated the feasibility of compacting and restructuring WTE plants in order to preserve its mechanical functions while enabling for flexible development and repurposing into various city resources.

I took advantage of the “stacked” model of a single-line incinerator proposed in literature and rescaled it to include three incineration lines and two turbine generators – approximately enough to handle the trash consumption of half of the Chaoyang District (the most populated district) in Beijing, China. Please see below for a step-by-step schematic from a presentation to a client. Designs were modeled using RHINO 6 and AutoCAD, and the presentation was created using InDesign.
