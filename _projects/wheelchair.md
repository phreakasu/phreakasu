As a part of MIT’s D-Lab Design class, my team and I worked with a paraplegic community partner from Mexico to design a low-cost wheelchair suitable for rural Mexican terrains. We prototyped a stair-climbing wheelchair using recycled bicycle parts (inspired by the Leveraged Freedom Chair) that generates torque based on a user’s upper body movement.
