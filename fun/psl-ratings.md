ordered hot with oat milk. from best to worst.

updated 2025 ratings:
- 1369: better than last time!
- Page & Leaf at Porter Square Books: solid flavor but not great latte art
- Elmendorf: same as above. can't believe it's 2025 and i'm paying $6+ for a latte without properly frothed milk :rage:
- Clear Flour Coffee Bar: actually a proper latte! but $$$
- Pepita: probably best latte overall but no pumpkin spice flavor??
- Tatte: okay but -1 but had to drink my 'for here' order while standing because there were no seats :angry:
- Smoot Std: too sweet and honestly quite small
- Flour: I love flour but i don't go for the coffee

my original list from 2021-2023:
- Cafe Luna: surprisingly. they’re not even a coffee place. probably just an accident.
- 1369: their syrup is made from pumpkin puree. Very good but sank to the bottom. 
- Render Coffee: in Boston, so coffee overall is better quality that Cambridge cafés
- Pepita: pretty solid. +1 for ambiance.
- Vester: a little better than okay. -1 for kendall square corporate vibe.
- Darwins (rip): not bad but very small and expensive (like all their seasonal drinks)
- Flour: just okay but convenient
- Area 4: better coffee than the rest but no pumpkin spice flavor :/
- Cafe Beatrice: no flavor in general. just get their pastries next time.
- New City: way too sweet. just get their ice cream next time.
- My best PSL ever was actually the pumpkin pie latte from Odd Meter Coffee in Salem! It made up for the mistake of visiting Salem in October.
